# WebChat

this was a little experiment I did

I used the github API to send messages to a .json file on this repo, obviously this isn't safe in any way and should not be used in a serious project

the API token has since been revoked and you can now only read messages

this was a fun experiment and I think it has given me an idea for a future project

if you want, you can view the messages that were sent before I took it down <a href="https://bonnie39.github.io/WebChat/">here</a>.
